Fun Fact about yourself.
I have built my own computer before!

Do you have any previous Data Science experience, if so explain!
I have some experience in the data science club. I've been to a few workshops, and also done a case competition before!

To answer the question in the second decrypted message, I think it means that just because data scientists find that certain variables and factors are related in certain ways after their analysis, i does not necessarily lead to a conclusion such as "factor x causes or influences factor y." There can be outside factors or causes  affect the data that would cause further research or data to realize. In short, just because a data scientist's work supports a certain conclusion, does not necessarily make it true.
